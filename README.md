I am a full stack Ruby and JavaScript developer, specialising in front end.

My significant skillset was furthered through my experience with QA, where I found that I had a passion for technology. I pursued this at first with my own self-directed learning, then seeking out opportunities such as courses at Bath City College and [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to gain a foundation knowledge of professional level software development. 

Outside of work, I love attending meetups to learn more about the field that I am excited by. I also enjoy exploring London's many galleries and museums. 

I am a self-driven and motivated professional, looking for a challenging new Technical opportunity in the London area. I am keen to continue creating while learning and following best practises.

## Skills

#### Communication

Utilising friendly and eloquent communication and interpersonal skills developed initially as a customer service representative at the Award-winning technology Start-up, [MoveGB](https://www.movegb.com). I always took the initiative to improve the company by suggesting process flow and product improvements. I even took it upon myself to design and implement an entirely new training guide for the Support Department at MoveGB in the short period of 3 weeks, allowing future team members to benefit from my significant knowledge base even after I left the company to pursue a career in software engineering. 

During my time at Makers I have created and maintained a [blog](https://caitlincooling.wordpress.com/). This was created primarily to act as a tool for prospective developers to assist them in bridging the knowledge gap that I first encountered. It also became an excellent way to reflect and document the experiences and learnings during my career change. 

I chose to mentored a Makers student as I was keen to share the invaluable skills and knowledge that I had gained.

#### Problem Solving and Critical Thinking

By positioning myself between the support and tech teams at moveGB, I became the go-to contact for multiple other departments, wishing to utilise my critical thinking skillset, knowledge and ability to tailor both the language and context of the solutions I provide to the parties involved,.

My innate problem solving ability was properly utilised when I moved in to my QA role. I was able to understand what products and features customers wanted to see in the website and applications they use on a daily basis. By working with the Technical department to design, develop and implement these components, the overall enquiries that reached the support team was reduced greatly.

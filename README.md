## CAITLIN COOLING
I am a full stack Ruby developer.

Through my experience with QA, I found that I had a passion for web and software. I pursued this at first with my own self-directed learning, then seeking out opportunities such as Makers Academy to gain a foundation knowledge of professional level software development. 

I am a self-driven and motivated professional, looking for a challenging new Technical opportunity in the London area. I am keen to continue creating while following best practises.

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout the duration of my career I have found that communication comes naturally to me, from handling effective dialogue  within the company, to partners and clients. As a result of this, I helped to implement an entire new training guide for the Support Department at MoveGB in a period of 4 weeks. 

During my time at Makers I have created and maintained a [blog](https://caitlincooling.wordpress.com/) about my experiences to maintain and further my written communication skills.

#### Problem Solving and Critical Thinking

Working in a fast moving startup meant that problem solving was a crucial skill to have. Working in this environment helped me to develop the skill greatly. I was the go to for not only my own team, but many other members of the company when they had difficulties to overcome and solve. I am also partial to a good sudoku!

During my time as a QA I found critical thinking to be an essential part of my role. I was not only checking for bugs, as the company had very limited code testing in place, I was checking the user journey and any flaws that this may have. I helped the product team to catch and fix many shortcomings before release, in turn reducing the overall enquiries that reached the Support Team.

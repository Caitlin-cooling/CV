I am a full stack Ruby and JavaScript developer, specialising in front end.

Through my experience with QA, I found that I had a passion for software. I pursued this at first with my own self-directed learning, then seeking out opportunities such as courses at Bath City College and Makers Academy to gain a foundation knowledge of professional level software development. 

Outside of work, I love attending meetups to learn more about the field that I am excited by. I also enjoy exploring London's many galleries and museums. 

I am a self-driven and motivated professional, looking for a challenging new Technical opportunity in the London area. I am keen to continue creating while learning and following best practises.

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout the duration of my career I have found that communication comes naturally to me and was given the responsibility of effectively handling dialogue with partners, clients and within the company itself. As a result of this, I took the initiative to design and implement an entirely new training guide for the Support Department at MoveGB in the short period of 3 weeks, allowing future team members to benefit from my significant knowledge base. 

During my time at Makers I have created and maintained a [blog](https://caitlincooling.wordpress.com/) about my experiences to further my written communication skills as well as be a tool for future developers. I also mentored a student at Makers Academy as I was keen to share the invaluable skills and knowledge that I had gained.

#### Problem Solving and Critical Thinking

Working in a fast moving startup meant that problem solving was a crucial skill to have. I was the go to for not only my own team, but many other members of the company when they had difficulties to overcome or solve.

During my time as a QA I found critical thinking to be an essential part of my role. I was not only checking for bugs, as the company had very limited code testing in place, but also the user journey and any flaws that this may have. I helped the product team to catch and fix many shortcomings before release, in turn reducing the overall enquiries that reached the Support Team.

## Experience

**MoveGB** (October 2017 - September 2018)    
*Quality Assurance* 

Responsible for manual testing of web and app features before release. As the only member of staff assigned to QA I was responsible for documenting tests and reporting bugs directly to the developers. Combined with my role of leading the Support Team, I was accountable for updating the team on any changes in the product.

**MoveGB** (October 2017 - September 2018)    
*Support Team Lead* 

Responsible for leading a team of 10, this included increasing productivity and implementing a new training structure as well as providing support for team growth.

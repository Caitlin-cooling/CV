I am a full stack Ruby and JavaScript developer, specialising in front end.

My significant skillset was furthered through my experience with QA, where I found that I had a passion for technology. I pursued this at first with my own self-directed learning, then seeking out opportunities such as courses at Bath City College and [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to gain a foundation knowledge of professional level software development. 

Outside of work, I love attending meetups to learn more about the field that I am excited by. I also enjoy exploring London's many galleries and museums. 

I am a self-driven and motivated professional, looking for a challenging new software opportunity in the London area. I am keen to continue creating while learning and following best practises.

## Skills

#### Learning abilities

I am a quick, logical and systematic learner, and my technical skillset is growing exponentially. In only 10 weeks at Makers Academy, I was able to gain JavaScript and Ruby programming abilities, as well as accepting the additional challenge of IOS app development in Swift for my final project.

#### Communication

By positioning myself between the support and tech teams at MoveGB, I became the go-to contact for multiple other departments, wishing to utilise my critical thinking skillset, knowledge and ability to tailor both the language and context of the solutions I provide to the parties involved.

During my time at Makers I have created and maintained a [blog](https://caitlincooling.wordpress.com/). This was created primarily to act as a tool for prospective developers to assist them in bridging the knowledge gap that I first encountered. It also became an excellent way to reflect and document the experiences and learnings during my career change. 

I chose to mentored a Makers student as I was keen to share the invaluable skills and knowledge that I had gained.

#### Problem Solving and Critical Thinking

By analysing quantitative department metrics for weekly reporting, I uncovered falling output and morale. To rectify the situation, I designed and implemented a systematic accountability and incentive program boosting productivity, efficiency and overall quality of work.
